[0.2s] If you're still struggling with your SEO
[1.8s] in 2026, don't worry, I got you. This is
[5.4s] Cloudy SEO. It's a skill I built for
[7.7s] cloud code. This isn't one tool, it's
[9.9s] 12. 12 specialized skills that know what
[12.4s] they're doing. Here we're talking about
[14.6s] SEO audit, which is a full website
[16.6s] audit. We have SEO page, which is a deep
[18.7s] single page analysis. We have SEO
[20.8s] sitemap, which is analyzes existing XML
[22.8s] sitemap. SEO sitemap generation. SEO
[25.3s] schema, which detects, validates, and
[27.0s] generates schema. We have SEO images
[29.0s] which is image optimization analysis,
[31.0s] technical SEO, content SEO which is eat
[34.1s] and content quality analysis. My
[35.7s] personal favorite which is SEO GEO based
[38.4s] on generative engine optimization. So if
[40.2s] you have any specific content pages or
[41.9s] blogs that you want them to be optimized
[43.7s] in a specific structure. So it will help
[45.7s] you optimize those pages. So the content
[48.5s] will be cited by AI like GBT, Gemini,
[51.2s] Cloud or Pacity. We have also SEO plan
[53.8s] which is a strategic SEO planning. We
[56.1s] have programmatic SEO, classic
[57.7s] programmatic SEO. We have competitor
[59.4s] pages, which is competitive, comparison,
[61.5s] page generation, and also our SEO Href
[64.1s] lang. So for let me show you exactly how
[66.0s] this skill works and how it can help
[67.4s] optimize your page so you can be seen by
[69.8s] the world. Let's dive right into it.
[71.8s] Going to run a pull website audit. Just
[74.0s] watch what happens. I'm going to put
[75.4s] forward slash here. SEO audit. I'm going
[77.5s] to put my page run kenstein.pro. I'm
[79.9s] going to press on enter. And that's it.
[82.6s] Right now, the agent knows exactly what
[84.2s] he's doing. uh he will start identifying
[86.6s] the the page itself. I'm going to just
[88.1s] choose this to bypass permission right
[89.6s] here. So he's forming a plan. He already
[91.4s] knows exactly what to do. Um he will
[93.9s] pull first the homepage which is ranking
[96.1s] standard pro as you see right here. So
[97.9s] he's identifying right here what sort of
[99.6s] business it is. Is it a SAS? Is it a
[101.4s] local business or anything else? Then he
[103.4s] is pulling the site map and robust text
[106.0s] right here. So why sitemap is required.
[109.0s] So it checks all the all the pages that
[111.6s] we have. And now he going to audit each
[113.3s] and every one of them one by one. He
[115.2s] also as you can see right here he has
[117.4s] also a to-dos list. So first he fetched
[120.0s] the homepage as I mentioned before so he
[121.5s] can identify exactly what sort of
[123.0s] mission business it is. Next we have the
[125.0s] crawl site structure internal links. So
[127.2s] checks all the pages. It runs the
[129.1s] technical SEO analysis. Then it runs the
[131.7s] schema structure data analysis
[134.2s] performance analysis visual and mobile
[136.3s] analysis. So he will also use playright.
[138.3s] It's a tool that lets AI to visually
[141.4s] view your page in a way and he will
[143.8s] identify also that and then in the end
[146.2s] he will generate an SEO health score and
[148.6s] final report. That's it. And afterwards
[151.7s] I can just ask hey listen craft for me
[153.7s] uh prompt for my other agent that will
[156.0s] do the fixes let's say for my page or at
[158.3s] the same time if I wants for a deeper
[159.9s] review I'll just ask hey generate for me
[161.7s] a PDF I want to have a PDF with visuals
[164.3s] and uh he will do that. Then I want to
[166.5s] analyze and we'll even look right here.
[168.4s] He's running one, two, three, four, five
[170.6s] agents in a parallel that are doing all
[172.6s] this job. So it doesn't take you hours.
[174.1s] It doesn't take you, let's say, 10 or 20
[175.7s] minutes. It will take you maybe no more
[177.4s] than two or 3 minutes for you to fully
[180.1s] analyze your page, which is damn
[182.0s] fantastic. So I'm going to fast forward
[183.9s] this till he finishes. I'm going to show
[185.4s] you the results and afterwards I'll try
[186.9s] to generate a PDF so you can also view
[188.6s] exactly what sort of report he is
[190.2s] crafting. So maybe if you want you can
[191.4s] share with your clients or with your
[192.6s] partners or even for yourselves so you
[193.8s] can use for reference to make relevant
[196.1s] updates so your page can rank. So just 3
[199.0s] minutes has passed here. He scraped all
[201.4s] the pages. I would say here depends a
[203.2s] lot on how many pages your website has.
[204.7s] So if it has more than 100 pages maybe
[206.6s] it'll take a little bit longer. But
[208.1s] overall look at this. We have the full
[209.8s] SEO audit report. We have the overall
[212.1s] SEO health score currently which is
[213.9s] quite bad by the way. It's a 57 out of
[216.0s] 100 because we're currently just
[217.1s] building the website right. We just uh
[218.6s] indexed it maybe like one week ago and
[220.3s] we're working right now on the SEO cuz
[221.9s] that's one point that why I introduced
[224.4s] this skill, why why this skill was
[225.8s] created. So it will help me with
[227.3s] everything SEO related. Yeah, even right
[229.6s] now we have the score breakdown which is
[231.0s] technical SEO, content quality, onpage
[233.2s] SEO. I will even zoom it so you'll be
[235.0s] able to see. Oh, not this like this.
[237.4s] I'll be able to zoom it so you'll be
[238.6s] able to see. So we have here the
[241.0s] technical SEO score right here. We have
[243.2s] the content quality. We have the on page
[245.4s] SEO score, the schema structure,
[247.1s] performance, images, and also AI search
[249.0s] readiness, which is quite quite bad. And
[251.0s] now my mission will be just to work on
[252.6s] that and make the improvements. We also
[254.1s] came here with a full audit report. If
[255.9s] we're going to open this, you have also
[257.5s] here the full audit report of our
[259.4s] specific website right now. Yeah,
[260.6s] structure quality. We have also the on
[262.4s] page SEO score. If you scroll down, so
[264.5s] everything needed for us to be free to
[267.5s] improve our website because that's the
[269.0s] point of this skill is to make sure that
[270.9s] the world's see you, right? And uh here
[273.6s] we have also an action plan. So we can
[275.5s] even feed this to the agent. So I can
[277.2s] just even copy this and I can paste it
[278.7s] inside my Renstein uh agent. And also
[281.4s] here we have screenshots. And now I can
[283.1s] even ask like hey listen uh based on
[286.4s] your overall audit please craft for me a
[289.4s] PDF document well arranged and set so I
[292.3s] can use for reference. Before that I'm
[294.9s] going to press on compact and then I'm
[296.4s] going to press on send this message.
[298.0s] Your PDF is ready at here. Boom. And
[301.4s] this is the PDF that it crafted. Let me
[303.3s] try even to magnify it a bit so you'll
[305.0s] be able to see exactly what it crafted
[306.6s] because it's damn fantastic. Here we
[308.1s] have a comprehensive SEO audit report
[309.8s] for ranking standard pro. Here we have
[311.6s] the overall health score. If I'm going
[313.3s] to scroll down, we have also the table
[315.0s] of content. We have the executive
[317.0s] summary of everything. The technical
[318.4s] SEO, content quality, onpage SEO,
[320.5s] schema, performance, images, AI search
[322.4s] and overall score for the SEO. We have
[324.9s] top five critical issues. We have
[326.5s] technical SEO, security headers, open
[329.0s] graph and social media tags. We have the
[331.0s] content quality. We have the blog
[332.4s] content analysis, the critical content
[334.0s] issues and much more. And now let me
[337.3s] show you exactly another skill that will
[339.1s] definitely save you a lot of time. So
[341.0s] the the second skill we're going to try
[342.4s] right now going to be the SEO schema. So
[343.8s] I'm going to push here forward/ SEO and
[346.3s] I'm going to write here schema, right?
[348.6s] You know here you need to give it your
[350.2s] one of the pages yours. So maybe we're
[351.9s] going to enter here a website my
[353.8s] website. Let's say for example in this
[355.0s] case I'm going to go for
[355.8s] rankingstein.pro. Maybe we're going to
[357.6s] choose the about page right now. So just
[359.2s] to check the schema of the about page,
[361.0s] copying it, going back, pasting it, send
[363.7s] right now. So what it will do right now,
[365.8s] it will scan the page. It will find
[367.5s] every piece of structure uh that we have
[370.3s] on the page like uh the JSON LD, the
[373.3s] micro data, the RDFA and validates all
[376.6s] of it. Yeah. And tells us exactly what
[379.3s] is missing in regards to our page
[381.1s] structure. And it knows what's
[382.7s] duplicated, by the way, because it has
[384.2s] those system prompts. And that skill is
[385.9s] specifically made for schema. So let's
[389.0s] wait for it to finish. I'm just going to
[390.4s] even also again fast forward it. I'm
[392.2s] going to show you exactly the results
[393.3s] which are happening. And that's done.
[396.0s] It's just again it took around 1 minute
[398.1s] and 20 seconds uh to do everything.
[400.1s] Start with scheme analysis for
[401.3s] Raenstein. Pro about for example current
[404.0s] health is four out of 10 which is three
[405.8s] JSON blocks found all identical homepage
[408.1s] and pricing right now. Yeah. So here
[410.2s] also what's wrong and also at the same
[411.8s] time files generated the schema report.
[413.6s] We have also full schema report that I
[415.3s] can just easily copy once again and put
[417.1s] it in my own agent that will going to
[418.4s] help me optimize this page. Also have
[420.5s] generated schema JSON. So here we have
[422.2s] already ready to build schema that we
[424.4s] can use for our website. So I can just
[425.8s] even copy this hole. I can just uh go to
[428.5s] my Rankenstein SEO assistant and I will
[431.7s] just uh paste the schema right here and
[433.2s] say hey listen apply the same schema
[435.4s] right there. Yep. Now going back here
[437.8s] I'm going to also show you another one
[439.6s] very important skill. As I mentioned
[441.7s] before it's my favorite. So I'm going to
[442.9s] just put forward slash SEO
[445.8s] geo and then I'm going to just put also
[448.5s] exact same page and uh this is
[451.8s] fantastic. So it will analyze also how
[454.0s] visible our content is to AI searches
[456.6s] like hey can uh chbt crawlb bot or cloud
[460.8s] crawl or capacity crawl your pages you
[463.0s] know and do you have any limits like or
[465.7s] do you have at least those let's say
[467.7s] llm's text files or are your paragraph
[470.1s] the right length to be cited because
[473.1s] there's a sweet spot if really between
[475.5s] 134 to 167 per passage and if you're
[478.7s] outside that AI agents will skip you
[480.7s] because AIs are quite quite lazy. Okay.
[483.4s] And right now it's fetching our page.
[486.0s] And again, I'm going to just fast
[487.3s] forward this. I want to show you exactly
[488.4s] the results of this skill. Also, so the
[490.7s] agent just now finished. And goodness,
[493.2s] I'm looking right here at this score.
[494.9s] I'm like, okay, now this is exactly what
[497.1s] I'm going to be working after this
[498.3s] video. Uh cuz right now our page is very
[500.6s] new, our website, our platform. Cuz I've
[502.7s] been working on this with my partner uh
[504.2s] Benjamin. We're creating Rankenstein. So
[505.8s] if you don't know what Rankenstein is,
[507.4s] you can just, you know, Google it or you
[509.8s] can just search for it. I'm going to
[510.7s] even put the link in the description cuz
[512.0s] it's a content creator, the best content
[514.4s] creator in the world. Anyway, my point
[517.2s] right now is I'm going to turn this from
[519.1s] a 27 at least uh into u 85 out of 100.
[523.4s] I'm going to make sure that this whole
[524.6s] page is optimized. And how I can do
[526.1s] that? I can just ask Cloudy, hey,
[527.8s] listen, craft from me prompt for my AI
[530.0s] agent. Additionally, I can just take
[531.4s] this report and I can just feed it to my
[533.7s] current uh clot agent right here. That
[535.7s] will take care of everything. Yeah,
[537.4s] because this is my mission right now.
[538.4s] Hey, I want my website to be found by
[541.0s] people. I want it to be crawled so it'll
[543.4s] be recommended also in EI searches and
[545.1s] that will be my my next missions mission
[547.6s] I would say. And listen guys uh just for
[549.6s] information we do have a few guardrails
[551.0s] here. So if I'm going to go back to the
[553.7s] um to the GitHub here even put quality
[556.3s] gates. I'm going to just tell you around
[557.6s] here. So the quality gates warning at
[560.2s] 100 pages. So let's say if you're
[563.0s] because it's a lot of context you know
[564.2s] for AI. So it will stop let's say
[566.2s] warning at 30 location pages. So it will
[568.7s] give you also quality gates. So to make
[570.4s] sure that hey all the pages are proper
[571.7s] and also the system is properly
[573.0s] processing all of your pages to provide
[575.0s] you that specific uh data based on the
[577.4s] audit that it's currently doing. And uh
[579.8s] I would say basically that's it. This is
[581.1s] cloud SEO. It's our beautiful ultimate
[585.0s] mega cloud code skill for everything SEO
[587.4s] related. We're going to work more more
[589.0s] on it. Maybe future going to apply also
[590.8s] more updates as we go. But it does its
[592.8s] job well. It crafts this beautiful,
[595.0s] beautiful uh reports and uh yeah, it's
[598.3s] doing everything I said related. I think
[600.1s] now you don't need to use any more five
[602.2s] different SEO tools. Everything is
[603.5s] covered into one and it's there. You can
[605.4s] just download it, guys. Uh it's there in
[607.7s] uh on GitHub. You're going to find the
[609.1s] link down in the description and just
[610.3s] let me show you how easy it is to set it
[612.4s] up. So, let's say you enter this git
[614.2s] which is github.com agricananiel cloud
[617.2s] SEO. Yeah. And here you can just have
[619.5s] one command to install on Unix, Mac OS
[622.2s] or Linux. So I can just copy this. I can
[624.4s] just open your own terminal. I will just
[626.8s] even open it right here. And I can just
[628.6s] paste this command and it will do
[631.1s] everything and it will install
[632.5s] everything. So usage cloud SEO audit.
[634.9s] Now I can just write cloudy right here.
[637.1s] Mr. Cloudy will appear and I just put
[638.7s] SEO and I have here all the SEO needed.
[641.5s] It's that simple. If it doesn't work,
[643.4s] don't worry. Okay, you can just install
[645.2s] cloudy inside your terminal or VS code
[648.2s] and there uh you can just copy this
[650.9s] whole git and just say like I'll just
[652.9s] even open one cloud. So just to show
[654.2s] right here like hey uh read this git and
[657.5s] download you know and you can just put
[659.0s] this link from GitHub and it will do
[660.5s] everything for you guys. Uh one more
[662.6s] thing if you if you want to use virtual
[665.1s] visual studio code uh not in a terminal
[667.4s] like as there are two ways to run this
[669.2s] is either you can use uh terminal which
[671.9s] not many people with programmatic
[673.5s] capabilities can do it right uh or you
[676.2s] can use visual studio code even for that
[678.3s] I have prepared another repo so I'm
[680.0s] going to also attach it inside the
[681.6s] description I'm just going to close this
[683.0s] so also there's another repo if you want
[684.9s] that will install everything for you I'm
[686.5s] going to just open it right here and
[688.4s] here we have also where was it cloud
[690.9s] code essential VS Code. So if you want
[693.0s] to have the exact same setup as I'm
[694.9s] having with Virtual Visual Studio Code
[697.4s] right here, you can just also use this
[699.6s] repo for reference, it will install uh
[702.0s] everything in regards to VS Code and
[704.4s] also cloud code totally. So same thing
[707.0s] um if you don't know how to install it,
[708.3s] you can just easily install it also with
[710.5s] one command either on Windows, Mac OS or
