[27.6s] how it works. Start. It's very easy
[30.2s] guys. Check it out. After you install
[31.7s] the skill and you need to launch cloud
[33.6s] code in any of your IDE that being
[35.7s] cursor, anti-gravity, warp or even your
[38.2s] terminal as you see right here. Yeah,
[39.9s] I'm going to just put here forward slash
[41.8s] ads for example. My goodness ads right
[44.2s] here. And I'm going to choose let's say
[45.9s] ads plan for the sake of this demo. So
[48.2s] right now what will happen? I'm going to
[49.5s] plan an ad for let's say for my SAS uh
[52.9s] for ranking standard pro because it's
[54.7s] brand new. It's there and I would like
[56.6s] to promote it. I want to build that
[58.3s] brand awareness. So here I'm going to
[60.4s] just even zoom in so you'll be able to
[61.6s] see like it's asking what type of
[63.4s] business are you you're are you planning
[66.2s] ads for SAS e-commerce local B2B. I
[69.2s] would choose because it's a SAS
[70.2s] Frankenstein is a SAS. What is your
[71.8s] primary advertising goal here? I would
[73.6s] choose brand awareness because it's it's
[75.0s] it's just brand new. Yeah, it's asking
[77.5s] also what is your advertising budget
[79.6s] range under 5K over 20 or 100? We're
[82.5s] going to just choose other. I'm going to
[83.8s] put here 1,00 100 $1,000 for example per
[88.4s] month here. Are you currently running
[89.7s] any paid ads? No. Starting fresh. Submit
[92.2s] answer. And that's it. Right now, oh my
[94.3s] goodness. Right now the the agent is uh
[97.4s] is running. I just I just pressed the
[99.2s] wrong button, guys. So right now the
[100.9s] agent is running and straight away it's
[102.2s] asking, hey, can I read these? Yes. Yes.
[103.8s] Yes. We're just going to put even this.
[105.0s] I'm going to change to bypass permission
[107.0s] right here. So don't need to always
[108.2s] press on accept. So he's reading these
[111.0s] files basically the skills. How can I
[112.7s] just show right here? So he's reading
[114.3s] the SAS MD file, the budget allocation
[116.7s] and also conversion tracking. Yeah, cuz
[118.9s] before he asked us some questions, we
[120.5s] answer. We just press yes, no, yes, no,
[122.3s] maybe, perhaps. And then afterwards, he
[124.0s] checked his skills. He's like, uh-huh.
[125.5s] Okay, so it's a SAS. He has a budget
[127.4s] over one one around $1,000, give or
[130.5s] take, and other questions. Right now,
[132.4s] straight away, he's asking another list
[134.2s] of questions right now. Yeah. So, is
[135.8s] your SAS product at B2B selling uh to
[138.3s] businesses or B2C selling to consumers?
[140.9s] So we're going to put here both PLG. No,
[143.0s] hey, can you produce short video
[144.2s] content? So hey, can you or you cannot I
[146.3s] mean anyone can build can create short
[148.4s] videos but uh some of them maybe cannot.
[151.2s] Maybe they're too shy to speak back
[152.6s] right now. Yeah. So let's say here I'm
[154.2s] going to choose yes in house I can
[155.9s] create videos for internal sources. Next
[157.6s] is choosing what does your SAS product
[159.2s] do and who is the ideal customer. So
[162.3s] here I'm going to just put here uh check
[164.5s] rankenstein.pro
[166.2s] website. Yeah because this is the
[167.9s] website of rankenstein.pro. I mean it's
[170.2s] more than enough in this case scenario
[171.2s] if let's say if you're a plumber or if
[173.0s] you have plumber or some local other
[174.7s] local service or maybe an e-commerce
[176.1s] site you can just put your website link
[177.9s] and as you can see right now here you
[180.0s] can see that hey it's web patching right
[181.5s] now running pro which is the website
[183.3s] itself then he's thinking so here you
[185.7s] can see like hey now I have all the data
[188.1s] now I have all the data I need let me
[189.7s] craft a realistic honest strategy for
[191.9s] SAS company with $1,000 per month budget
[194.1s] focused on brand awareness starting
[195.6s] fresh yeah based on the questions that
[197.5s] we answered before and here is key
[199.0s] consideration s 1,000 per month brand
[201.3s] awareness starting fresh need to be very
[203.6s] focused one platform max maybe maybe two
[205.9s] of them right now yeah so with 1k per
[208.0s] month for sales brand awareness so
[209.5s] LinkedIn is too expensive Google search
[211.4s] is conversion focused meta Facebook
[213.5s] Instagram is the best for awareness and
[215.0s] low budgets and YouTube could work for
[217.0s] awareness but needs video content Tik
[218.8s] Tok will work if they have video content
[221.0s] capability right now yeah this is also
[223.5s] based on his internal knowledge and now
[225.8s] he's starting crafting the ads for us so
[228.2s] look at that So even he's thinking I'm
[229.8s] going to even again zoom in so we be
[231.0s] able to see. So now I have a clear
[232.5s] picture ranking pro a SEO content
[235.0s] engine. So if I'm going to go right now
[236.7s] to rankstein pro just going show you
[238.7s] around. So I'm going to go here ranking
[240.8s] pro. This is one of the ses we're
[242.7s] currently building me and Benjamin. Um
[244.6s] it's basically it's a blog creator right
[246.3s] now. Yeah. So he scripted the site. So
[248.3s] he enter on this website. He checked the
[250.0s] homepage. He already got exactly what
[251.9s] this business is about and then he
[253.7s] started crafting the the ads plan for
[256.4s] us. I'm going to zoom in back so I'll be
[258.0s] able to see exactly his thinking because
[259.8s] it's very important guys. Uh maybe if
[261.9s] you're used let's say to these workflows
[264.2s] perhaps. Yes. Nan is also amazing. I
[266.2s] will not deny it. But here I mean if you
[268.2s] want to go to the new age cuz I would
[270.1s] say these agentic workflows they're
[271.8s] fantastic if you know exactly how to set
[273.7s] them up. Yeah. So he created a plan for
[275.8s] us. So he's like hey update to create an
[278.2s] ad strategy uh campaign architecture
[281.2s] create a budget plan and then a creative
[283.9s] brief right here. So maybe let's say you
[285.8s] don't want to go for LinkedIn. Maybe you
[287.3s] want to go for let's say YouTube only
[289.8s] YouTube. You can definitely just say to
[291.6s] a message, hey listen, I want to go only
[293.4s] for YouTube. I'm damn all in on YouTube
[296.4s] for example. Right now you or maybe if
[297.5s] you want to go only for Google ads it's
[299.2s] just a matter of sentence if it's just a
[301.2s] matter of thoughts a pro a prompt
[303.1s] really. So just put a prompt anything
[305.0s] you want you can do that. Also if you
[306.9s] want to have a PDF you can do PDF. If
[309.2s] you want to connect it through an MCP
[311.0s] server strapped away to Google Analytics
[312.9s] you can also do that. So you can easily
[315.0s] just build on top of this uh cloudy ads
[318.2s] skill with ease. So anything you want
[320.6s] can be done only if you request it
[323.0s] properly. So for that it's required a
[324.7s] little bit of content engineering but I
[326.4s] think anyone can do that because I think
[328.2s] you're texting every day right on
[329.4s] WhatsApp or messengers or Instagram. So
[331.6s] definitely you can do that. You just
[333.1s] give it some time. you just uh check
[335.3s] here and there and it going to give for
[337.0s] you the perfect perfect plan and so you
[341.2s] can create the best performing ads right
[344.6s] so I'm going to just stop right now I'm
[345.8s] going to fast forward so we're going to
[347.4s] see the results okay guys so currently
[350.1s] he has finished and let's see exactly
[351.8s] what he crafted right here I'm going to
[353.4s] even zoom in right now and here we have
[355.0s] a strategy overview here is platform
[356.8s] meta only Facebook and Instagram the
[358.6s] right call at $1,000 per month so he
[361.8s] thought about our let's say budget In
[364.0s] this case scenario was 1,000 cuz if I
[365.8s] would have provided let's say maybe
[366.9s] 2,000 3,000 or 4,000 of course he would
[369.2s] recommend maybe Google ads or any other
[370.9s] ads and Google search 1.5k if you want
[374.2s] to go but are too expensive for this
[375.9s] budget. So expected results at 1K per
[378.5s] month is 70 80,000 impressions per
[380.9s] month. 11K video views okay per per
[384.4s] month uh 200 400 website visits per
[386.6s] month and also cost per 1k reaches
[388.7s] around $25 to $33 which is quite well
[391.8s] you know so deliverable created but here
[393.4s] we have the ad strategy it's a full
[395.1s] strategic plan so competitive landscape
[397.7s] platform rational. So if I'm going to
[398.8s] open this right now here you can see
[400.5s] it's a markdown file by the way because
[402.7s] Claudia he likes markdown. He's digging
[404.7s] markdown like crazy. Even his skills are
[406.5s] in markdown. But let's say maybe for you
[408.6s] cuz maybe you're a nontechnical person.
[410.3s] You don't like markdown. Guys, don't
[411.7s] worry. You just close this. You go here
[413.8s] and say, "Hey, I want to have a PDF well
[417.6s] set and designed with graphs for example
[421.1s] right now." Yeah. And that's it. Right
[423.7s] now, we can just wait for it to craft a
[425.0s] PDF. So, it's going to be easier for us
[426.9s] to read it. And if you want to have
[428.8s] anything else except the images and
[430.6s] videos because cloud cannot generate
[432.3s] those images yet. or if you want to
[434.1s] maybe connect an MCP server to it or
[436.5s] maybe some API keys to generate those
[438.0s] videos even you can do that here. The
[440.6s] only limit is your imagination. So let's
[443.0s] wait for a bit. If you want to convert
[444.4s] now everything into a well set uh PDF
[447.0s] and I'm going to show you in a bit. Okay
[449.2s] guys, so the agent just now finished and
[450.9s] let me show you exactly what I popped.
[452.2s] But before that, let's see through his
[454.2s] thinking for you to understand exactly
[455.8s] how he generated the PDF. I'm going to
[457.7s] try to zoom in. So let me show you just
[459.3s] around. So here he's like hey I'll
[461.0s] create a professional design HTML report
[462.6s] charts and convert it to PDF right here.
[465.0s] So he's going he's doing his thinking
[466.8s] he's analyzing and then he's creating
[468.7s] the Python script by the way uh for the
[471.7s] PDF uh generation and then he's
[473.8s] generating the PDF report with charts.
[475.9s] Going more down he has created the PDF
[478.0s] and then he's generating the PDF with
[479.6s] charts and then he's reading each and
[481.8s] every part of PDFs right here. If you
[483.7s] want to open even he created here the
[485.0s] the charts etc. So he's like, "Oh
[486.6s] wait a moment. Uh there are a few stuff
[488.2s] which are not proper, not well arranged.
[490.0s] Let me fix that." And then he checked
[491.6s] those and he fixed those by himself. I
[494.0s] was not here at all. So this whole
[495.8s] process took like around how long? Maybe
[498.6s] 3 minutes I would say for him to
[500.3s] generate this full PDF. So let me try to
[502.4s] open it right here. Where was it? Right
[505.4s] here. This is exactly what sort report
[508.4s] he has created even in the style of
[509.8s] Frankenstein. So let's see around. So
[511.5s] paid advertising strategy. Super ranking
[513.4s] standard pro AI SEO content engine
[516.3s] strategic plan right monthly budget
[518.8s] platform meta goal awareness timeline 12
[521.6s] weeks cool cool nice prepare for Daniel
[524.4s] and Benjamin here we go right now so
[527.0s] here we have the executive summary for
[528.4s] the rockenstein bud budget reality right
[530.4s] now he's also competitive landscape he
[532.4s] checked for competitors guys how cool is
[535.0s] that so he's not just fluffing here not
[537.0s] just oh my goodness he researched online
[540.2s] the internet he checked for competitors
[542.6s] And beautiful you got we got also
[544.7s] information about the competitors also
[546.3s] right here and going more down messaging
[549.0s] wedge. So the only AI content engine
[550.6s] that starts with SER research, not the
[553.4s] blank prompt because that's correct. And
[555.6s] we have the overall ads plan right now
[558.2s] even with charts even in our own style
[560.4s] if really okay launch now lowest CPM is
[563.4s] in January January March. So let's say
[565.9s] it want to start right now. Um do wow
[568.4s] wow I mean beautiful beautiful report
[571.2s] beautiful charts if really I mean this
[573.5s] is mostly like what a what an ad agency
[575.5s] is doing and afterwards I can just build
[579.1s] on top of that we have a full plan of
[581.4s] action in regards to advertisement is
[583.8s] giving us metrics is giving us what to
[585.5s] do I'm like and of course if you want
[587.2s] something else maybe you want to go for
[588.6s] meta you can just easily say hey listen
[590.7s] I don't want to go for meta but I want
[592.3s] to go for Google ads with YouTube I'm
[594.6s] going to make a lot of shorts and I want
[596.3s] to do it for 2 weeks. Let's plan that.
[598.9s] Of course, you can do that one also. As
[600.6s] I mentioned before, your only limit is
[602.7s] your imagination. So, with that, let's
[604.6s] say if you have maybe some existing ads,
[606.6s] maybe I'll even I'll try the way even to
[608.7s] launch this on the current ads video.
[611.0s] So, I'm going to use cloudy ads to run
[613.0s] ads on this video. So, if you've seen
[614.6s] this video through an ad, I mean, you
[616.1s] can see exactly it targeted you in a
[619.2s] way. But, uh just saying you like, hey,
[621.8s] everything is possible. It's not like,
[623.4s] oh my goodness, it's put in stone. I
[625.0s] will do only these. Uh if you want to
[627.0s] have anything else, maybe you want to
[628.3s] have some feedback on the ads that
[629.9s] you're currently creating or the you the
[631.8s] videos on Tik Tok or whatever you're
[633.5s] doing, even pictures. And if you want to
[635.4s] have maybe some text, some titles, some
[637.0s] descriptions, some research in regards
[638.6s] to those ads, Cloudy Ads can do that for
[641.0s] you. So even now, I say like, hey, I
[642.3s] want to go for YouTube. How should we
[643.6s] speed the $1,000 between Google search
[645.6s] and YouTube? Right now, yeah, let's go
[646.9s] for 6040 recommended as per cloudy code.
[649.4s] He has that knowledge because his whole
[651.7s] base knowledge I'm going to show right
[653.0s] here. It's based on the search. Here we
[655.1s] have four documents. Again, I'm going to
[657.0s] zoom in. So, four documents right here
[659.8s] that uh this whole agent skill was
[662.6s] created from. It's over 2,500 websites
[666.1s] by the way, give or take, in regards to
[667.8s] the best ads practices. And again, of
[670.2s] course, it's in markdown because Cloudy
[671.5s] likes markdown. And guys, this is just
[673.7s] one example how I'm planning ads with
[675.9s] cloud ads. But of course, you can do a
[678.9s] lot more. I will even try to zoom in
[681.5s] this part right here. You can also read
[683.2s] the git. So you can go once again to the
[684.7s] git, try to install these ads if you
[686.8s] want to run any sort of ads. You don't
[688.1s] need to have a budget for,000 just for
[689.5s] information. You can do even for $50 or
[692.0s] $100 if you want to bring some more
[693.7s] clients. But I know for sure that this
[695.8s] scale will definitely help you in the
[697.8s] long run. So I'm going to make myself a
[699.1s] little bit bigger right here. Almost
[701.4s] almost almost almost maybe here like
[703.1s] this and like this guys once again this
[705.8s] is cloudy ads as you see right here it's
[708.6s] the ultimate ads agency skill you can
[711.6s] say for cloudy code uh you can just
[714.6s] download it is there for free for you
[717.1s] guys so uh you can run it you can test
[719.6s] it you can make it even better try to
[721.0s] fork it try to maybe make some
[722.4s] improvements maybe not only Python maybe
[724.3s] you can add also here some MCP servers
[726.6s] but it's there and I hope you're going
[728.6s] to like it drop a like drop a comment
[731.0s] and see you next time.
