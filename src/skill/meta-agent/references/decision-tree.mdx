# Decision Tree and Terminology

This reference helps decide which OpenCode component to build and clarifies common terminology.

## Terminology

- Command: a slash command definition (explicit invocation).
- Skill: a SKILL.md instruction set that triggers automatically.
- Agent: a scoped assistant with specific tools and instructions.
- Plugin: a TypeScript/JavaScript module that adds tools, hooks, agents, and config.
- Tool: a Zod-validated function exposed by a plugin.
- MCP server: an external service that provides tools or context.

## Component Differences (Summary)

| Component | When to Choose                                | Invocation          | Best For                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Command   | User explicitly wants a one-off workflow      | Manual (`/command`) | Task recipes, guided prompts       |
| Skill     | Needs automatic guidance based on triggers    | Auto-trigger        | Reusable instructions, checklists  |
| Agent     | Dedicated assistant with tool scope           | Manual or config    | Long-running workflows, delegation |
| Plugin    | Needs hooks, custom tools, or SDK access      | Auto-load           | Advanced automation, integrations  |
| MCP       | External system must be queried or controlled | Tool call           | Cross-system workflows             |

## Decision Tree (Text)

```
Start
  |
  |-- Does the user want an explicit command they run on demand?
  |      -> Yes: create a command
  |      -> No:
  |
  |-- Does this need to auto-trigger based on user input?
  |      -> Yes: create a skill
  |      -> No:
  |
  |-- Do we need custom tools, event hooks, or SDK access?
  |      -> Yes: create a plugin (tools + hooks)
  |      -> No:
  |
  |-- Does the user want a dedicated assistant with scoped tools?
  |      -> Yes: create an agent
  |      -> No: clarify requirements
```

## MCP vs Plugin

Choose MCP when you must call an external service. Choose a plugin when you need to add tools, hooks, or agents inside OpenCode. Use both when a plugin tool needs to call an MCP server.

## Notes

- If the user says "tool", ask whether they mean a command, a skill, or a plugin tool.
- Skills are best when the instruction is stable and should auto-trigger.
- Commands are best when the user wants explicit control.
