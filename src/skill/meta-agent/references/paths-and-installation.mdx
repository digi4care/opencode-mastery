# Paths and Installation

Use these paths when placing generated files. Always confirm the target location if the project layout is unknown.

## Project Paths (Common)

- Commands: `.opencode/commands/<command>.md`
- Skills (runtime): `.opencode/skill/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- Plugins: `.opencode/plugin/` (preferred) or `.opencode/plugins/`

## Repository Paths (This Repo)

- Skill sources: `src/skill/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- Examples: `src/skill/<skill-name>/examples/`
- References: `src/skill/<skill-name>/references/`

## Rules

- Always use `skill/` (singular), never `skills/`.
- Verify plugin directory before writing.
- Prefer `bun run` for JS/TS scripts and `uv` for Python.

If you are unsure, consult opencode-mastery or ask the user to confirm the target directory.
