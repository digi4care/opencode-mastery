## Common Patterns to Detect

### Efficiency Patterns

- **Redundant reads:** Same file read multiple times
- **Tool spam:** Many small tool calls instead of batched
- **Context bloat:** Not pruning/digesting when needed
- **Planning gaps:** Starting without clear plan

### Quality Patterns

- **Hallucination:** Stating non-existent facts
- **Over-engineering:** Complex solutions for simple problems
- **Under-planning:** Jumping to code without analysis
- **Missing validation:** Not testing or verifying solutions

### Communication Patterns

- **Verbose responses:** Too much explanation
- **Missing summaries:** Not summarizing at key points
- **Unclear structure:** No headers, lists, or organization
