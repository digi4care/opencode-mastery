# Troubleshooting

## Tool Does Not Run

- Check that the plugin file is available in runtime plugin directory.
- Verify command wrapper name matches tool name.

## Dry-Run Shows Changes But Nothing Written

- Expected behavior. Set `confirm: true` and `dryRun: false` to write.

## Quality Gate Blocks Apply

- Review before/after metrics.
- Add missing trigger phrases, error handling, or tests.
- Re-run optimize in dry-run until score is non-negative delta.

## References Missing in Registry

- Ensure `references/registry.json` contains every referenced filename.
- Re-run create/optimize with references list and confirm.
