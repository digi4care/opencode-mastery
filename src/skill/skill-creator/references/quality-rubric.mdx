# Quality Rubric

Use this rubric to validate skill quality before applying changes.

## Scoring Dimensions

- Trigger quality: clear WHAT + WHEN + trigger phrases + negative triggers.
- Structure quality: required sections present and concise.
- Workflow specificity: explicit ordered steps.
- Error handling: concrete failure cases and responses.
- Test readiness: should-trigger, should-not-trigger, functional prompts.
- Progressive disclosure: deep content moved to `references/`.

## Pass Criteria

- Required sections are present:
  - `When to Use Me`
  - `Workflow`
  - `Error Handling`
  - `Quick Tests`
  - `References`
- Quality score does not regress.
- Word count stays within target constraints.

## Gate Policy

- If score improves or stays equal: apply can proceed.
- If score drops: block apply and return before/after diagnostics.
