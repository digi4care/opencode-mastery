## Confidence Scoring

- High (>= 80%): from cached docs, verified sources
- Medium (60-79%): from GitHub research, verified code
- Low (< 60%): needs confirmation

When confidence is low, say so and ask for confirmation.

## Never Guessing

- If information is missing, say so.
- Offer to search GitHub or request more input.
- Always cite sources when available.
